# LuminAI

**LuminAI** is an AI-powered engineering assistant designed to help aerospace
engineers streamline workflows, manage configuration-controlled artifacts,
and automate repetitive reporting/documentation tasks. Built with open-source
tools (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS, Streamlit),
it demonstrates how large language models can augment engineering processes.
